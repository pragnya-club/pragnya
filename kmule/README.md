My name is MULE KOWSHIK REDDY. I have completed my schooling in ADITYA School. I have completed my intermediate in tirumala Junior College. I am fascinated to the technology since my childhood. In my childhood whenever I used to see a computer, I used to play around it started to learn how to use it gradually. My hobbies in my free time are watching movies, playing sports, and going out with my friends.    

I am very much interested in learning new things. Back in my childhood days I used to play around with the toys and some things and used disassemble them and again I used to put everything back. The main reason I have chosen CSE as my stream because of my interest towards the computers. I am also very much interested in how the we are able to operate things from any where in the wolrd.
