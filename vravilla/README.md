# RVS Saran

My name is RVS Saran. I have completed my schooling in Little Angels School. I have completed my intermediate in Narayana Junior College. I am fascinated to the technology since my childhood. In my childhood whenever I used to see a computer, I used to play around it started to learn how to use it gradually. My hobbies in my free time are watching movies, playing sports, and going out with my friends.  

**I am very much interested in learning new things.** Back in my childhood days I used to play around with the toys and some things and used disassemble them and again I used to put everything back. The main reason I have chosen CSE as my stream because of my interest towards the computers. I am also very much interested in how the we are able to operate things from anywhere in the world.
