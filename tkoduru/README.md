## About Me
Hello!!!
Trivarna here, a CSE sophomore at GITAM and a member of the Gitam ACM club.
I'm thrilled to be a member of the Pragnya club.
Meeting new people and getting to know them never ceases to excite me.
I enjoy solving problems using coding.
My long-term objective is to work for a well-paying corporation and expand my skill set.
